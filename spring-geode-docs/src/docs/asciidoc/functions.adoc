== Function Implementations & Executions

=== Background

Distributed processing, particularly in conjunction with data access and mutation operations, is a very effective
and efficient use of clustered computing resources.  This is along the same lines as {wikipedia-docs}/MapReduce[MapReduce].

A naively conceived query returning potentially hundreds of thousands, or even millions of rows of data in a result set
back to the application that queried and requested the data can be very costly, especially under load.  Therefore, it is
typically more efficient to move the processing and computations on the predicated data set to where the data resides,
perform the required computations, summarize the results and then send the reduced data set back to the client.

Additionally, when the computations are handled in parallel, across the cluster of computing resources, the operation
can be performed much faster.  This typically involves intelligently organizing the data, which implies partitioning
(a.k.a. sharding) and balancing the data set across the cluster.

Well, both Apache Geode and Pivotal GemFire address this very important application concern in its
{apache-geode-docs}/developing/function_exec/chapter_overview.html[Function Execution] framework.

Spring Data for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#function-annotations[builds] on
this Functional framework by enable developers to {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#function-implementation[implement]
and {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#function-execution[execute] GemFire/Geode Functions using a very simple POJO,
annotation-based configuration model.

TIP: See {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#_implementation_vs_execution[here] for the difference between
Function implementation & executions.

Taking this 1 step further, Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire _auto-configures_ and enables both Function
implementation and execution out-of-the-box, so that you can immediately begin writing Functions and invoking them
without you having to worry about all the necessary plumbing and setup.  You can rest assured that it will just work
as expected.

=== Applying Functions

Earlier, when we talked about <<geode-caching-provider, caching>>, we described a `LoanApplicationService` class
that could process eligibility when a `Person` applied for a financial loan.

This can be a very resource intensive operation (i.e. expensive!), since it might involve collecting credit history,
employment history, information on existing, outstanding/unpaid loans, and so on and so forth.  We applied caching
to not have to recompute/redetermine eligibility every time a loan office may want to review the decision with
the customer.

But what about computing eligibility in the first place?

Currently the application's `LoanApplicationService` class seems to be designed to fetch the data and perform
the eligibility determination in place.  However, it might be far better to distribute the processing and even
determine eligibility for a larger group of people at once.  Maybe even multiple people are involved in
a single decision, as is typically the case.

We implement an `EligibilityDeterminationFunction` class using SDG very simply as:

.Function implementation
[source,java]
----
@Component
class EligibilityDeterminationFunction {

    @GemfireFunction(HA = true, hasResult = true, optimizeForWrite=true)
    public EligibilityDecision determineEligibility(FunctionContext functionContext, Person person, TimeSpan timeSpan) {
        ...
    }
}
----

Using SDG's {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/function/annotation/GemfireFunction.html[`@GemfireFunction`]
annotation, it is easy to implement our Function using a POJO method.  SDG handles registering this POJO method
as a proper Function with GemFire/Geode appropriately.

If we now want to call this Function from our Spring Boot, `ClientCache` application, then we simply define
a Function Execution interface with a method name matching the Function name, and targeting the execution
on the "EligibilityDecisions" Region:

.Function execution
[source,java]
----
@OnRegion("EligibilityDecisions")
interface EligibilityDeterminationExecution {

  EligibilityDecision determineEligibility(Person person, TimeSpan timeSpan);

}
----

We can then inject the `EligibilityDeterminationExecution` into our `LoanApplicationService` like any other
object/Spring bean:

.Function use
[source,java]
----
@Service
class LoanApplicationService {

    private final EligibilityDeterminationExecution execution;

    public LoanApplicationService(EligibilityDeterminationExecution execution) {
        this.execution = execution;
    }

    @Cacheable("EligibilityDecisions", ...)
    EligibilityDecision processEligility(Person person, TimeSpan timeSpan) {
        return this.execution.determineEligibility(person, timeSpan);
    }

}
----

Just like caching, no addition configuration is required to enable and find your application Function implementations
and executions. Simply build and run.  Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire handles the rest.

TIP: It is common to implement and register your application Functions on the server and execute them from the client.
