== Continuous Query

Arguably, the most invaluable of applications are those that can process a stream of events as they happen,
and intelligently react in near real-time to the countless changes in the data over time.  The most useful
of frameworks are those that can make processing a stream of events, as they happen, as easy as possible.

Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire does just that, without users having to perform any complex setup
or configure any necessary infrastructure components to enable such functionality.  Developers can simply define
the criteria for the data they are interested in and implement a handler to process the stream of events
as they occur.

Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire make defining criteria for data of interests easy when using
{apache-geode-docs}/developing/continuous_querying/chapter_overview.html[Continuous Query (CQ)]. With CQ, you can
express the criteria matching the data of interests using a query predicate.  Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire supports
the {apache-geode-docs}/developing/querying_basics/query_basics.html[Object Query Language (OQL)] for defining
and executing queries.  OQL is not unlike SQL, and supports projections, query predicates, ordering and aggregates.
And, when used in CQs, they execute continuously, firing events when the data changes in such ways as to match
the criteria expressed in the query predicate.

Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire combines the ease of expressing interests in data using an OQL
query statement with implementing the listener handler callback, in 1 easy step.

For example, suppose we want to perform some follow up action anytime a customer's loan application is either
approved or denied.

First, the application model for our `EligibilityDecision` class might look something like:

.EligibilityDecision class
[source,java]
----
@Region("EligibilityDecisions")
class EligibilityDecision {

    private final Person person;

    private Status status = Status.UNDETERMINED;

    private final Timespan timespan;

    ...

    enum Status {

        APPROVED,
        DENIED,
        UNDETERMINED,

    }
}
----

Then, we can implement and declare our CQ event handler methods:

[source,java]
----
@Component
class EligibilityDecisionPostProcessor {


    @ContinuousQuery(name = "ApprovedDecisionsHandler",
        query = "SELECT decisions.*
                 FROM /EligibilityDecisions decisions
                 WHERE decisions.getStatus().name().equalsIgnoreCase('APPROVED')")
    public void processApprovedDecisions(CqEvent event) {
        ...
    }

    @ContinuousQuery(name = "DeniedDecisionsHandler",
        query = "SELECT decisions.*
                 FROM /EligibilityDecisions decisions
                 WHERE decisions.getStatus().name().equalsIgnoreCase('DENIED')")
    public void processDeniedDecisions(CqEvent event) {
        ...
    }
}
----

Thus, anytime eligibility is processed and a decision as been made, either approved or denied, our application
will get notified, and as an application developer, you are free to code your handler and respond to the event
anyway you like.  And, because our Continuous Query handler class is a component, or bean in the Spring
`ApplicationContext`, we can auto-wire any other beans to carry out the applications function.

This is not unlike Spring's {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#jms-annotated[Annotation-based listener endpoints]
using in (JMS) message listeners/handlers, except in Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire, you do not need to do
anything special to enable this functionality.  Just declare the `@ContinuousQuery` annotation on a POJO handler method
and off you go.  Simple!
