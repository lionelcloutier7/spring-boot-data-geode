== Data Serialization with PDX

Anytime data is overflowed or persisted to disk, transferred between clients and servers, peers in a cluster or between
different clusters in a multi-site topology, then all data stored in Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire must be serializable.

To serialize objects in Java, object types must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface.  However, if you have
a large number of application domain object types that currently do not implement `java.io.Serializable`, then
refactoring hundreds or even thousands of class types to implement `Serializable` would be a tedious task just to
store and manage those objects in Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire.

Additionally, it is not just your application domain object types you necessarily need to worry about either.  If you
used 3rd party libraries in your application domain model, any types referred to by your application domain object types
stored in Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire must be serializable too.  This type explosion may bleed into class types
for which you may have no control over.

Furthermore, Java serialization is not the most efficient format given that meta-data about your types is stored with
the data itself.  Therefore, even though Java serialized bytes are more descriptive, it adds a great deal of overhead.

Then came Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire's {apache-geode-docs}/developing/data_serialization/gemfire_pdx_serialization.html[PDX serialization]
format.  PDX stands for _Portable Data Exchange_, and achieves 4 goals:

1. Separates type meta-data from the data itself making the bytes more efficient during transfer.  Apache Geode
and Pivotal GemFire maintain a type registry storing type meta-data about the objects serialized using PDX.

2. Supports versioning as your application domain types evolve.  It is not uncommon to have old and new applications
deployed to production, running simultaneously, sharing data, and possibly using different versions of the same domain
types. PDX allows fields to be added or removed while still preserving interoperability between old and new application
clients without loss of data.

3.  Enables objects stored as PDX bytes to be queried without being de-serialized.  Constant de/serialization of data
is a resource intensive task adding to the latency of each data request when redundancy is enabled.  Since data must be
replicated across peers in the cluster to preserve High Availability (HA), and serialized to be transferred, keeping
data serialized is more efficient when data is updated since it will likely need to be transferred in order to maintain
redundancy and availability.

4. Enables interoperability between native language clients (e.g. C/C++/C#) and Java language clients, with each
being able to access the same data set regardless from where the data originated.

However, PDX is not without its limitations either.

For instance, unlike Java serialization, it does not handle cyclic dependencies.  Therefore, you must be careful
how you structure and design your application domain object types.

Also, PDX cannot handle field type changes.  While GemFire/Geode's general
{apache-geode-docs}/developing/data_serialization/gemfire_data_serialization.html[Data Serialization] handles
{apache-geode-docs}/developing/delta_propagation/chapter_overview.html[deltas], this is not achievable without
de-serializing the object bytes since it involves a method invocation, which defeats 1 of the key benefits of PDX,
preserving format.

However, we thing the benefits of using PDX greatly outweight the limitations and therefore have enabled PDX by default
when using Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire.

There is nothing special you need to do.  Simply code your types and rest assured that objects of those types will be
properly serialized when overflowed/persisted to disk, transferred between client and servers, or peers in the cluster
and even when data is transferred over the WAN when using GemFire/Geode's multi-site topology.

the standard Java Serialization format.

=== SDG `MappingPdxSerializer` vs. GemFire/Geode's `ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer`

Under-the-hood, Spring Boot for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire {spring-data-geode-docs-html?/#bootstrap-annotation-config-pdx[enables]
and uses Spring Data for Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire's {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/mapping/MappingPdxSerializer.html[MappingPdxSerializer]
to serialize your application domain objects using PDX.

TIP: Refer to the SDG {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#mapping.pdx-serializer[Reference Guide] for more details
on the `MappingPdxSerializer` class.

The `MappingPdxSerializer` offers several advantages above and beyond GemFire/Geode's own
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/pdx/ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer.html[ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer] class.

TIP: Refer to Apache Geode's {apache-geode-docs}/developing/data_serialization/auto_serialization.html[User Guide]
for more details about the `ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer`.

The SDG `MappingPdxSerializer` offers the following capabilities:

1. PDX serialization is based on Spring Data's powerful mapping infrastructure and meta-data, as such...

2. Includes support for both `includes` and `excludes` with {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#mapping.pdx-serializer.type-filtering[type filtering].
Additionally, type filters can be implemented using Java's `java.util.function.Predicate` interface as opposed to GemFire/Geode's
limited regex capabilities provided by the `ReflectionBasedAutoSerializer` class.  By default, `MappingPdxSerializer`
excludes all types in the following packages: `java`, `org.apache.geode`, `org.springframework` & `com.gemstone.gemfire`.

3. Handles {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#mapping.pdx-serializer.transient-properties[transient object fields & properties]
when either Java's `transient` keyword or Spring Data's `@Transient` annotation is used.

4. Handles {spring-data-geode-html}/#mapping.pdx-serializer.read-only-properties[read-only object properties].

5. Determines the identifier of your entities when you annotate the appropriate entity field or property with
Spring Data's {spring-data-commons-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/annotation/Id.html[@Id] annotation.

6. Allows `o.a.g.pdx.PdxSerializers` to be registered in order to {spring-data-geode-docs}/#mapping.pdx-serializer.custom-serialization[customize the serialization]
of nested entity field/property types.

Number two above deserves special attention since the `MappingPdxSerializer` "excludes" all Java, Spring
and Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire types, by default.  But, what happens when you need to serialize 1 of those types?

For example, suppose you need to be able to serialize objects of type `java.security.Principal`.  Well, then you can
override the excludes by registering a "include" type filter, like so:

[source,java]
----
package example.app;

import java.security.Principal;
import ...;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnablePdx(serializerBeanName = "myCustomMappingPdxSerializer")
class SpringBootApacheGeodeClientCacheApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootApacheGeodeClientCacheApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    MappingPdxSerializer myCustomMappingPdxSerializer() {

        MappingPdxSerializer customMappingPdxSerializer =
            MappingPdxSerializer.newMappginPdxSerializer();

        customMappingPdxSerializer.setIncludeTypeFilters(
            type -> Principal.class.isAssignableFrom(type));

        return customMappingPdxSerializer;
    }
}
----

TIP: Normally, you do not need to explicitly declare SDG's `@EnablePdx` annotation to enable and configure PDX.
However, if you want to override auto-configuration, as we have demonstrated above, then this is what you must do.
